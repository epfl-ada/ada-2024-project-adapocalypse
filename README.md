# Mov'She

Mov'She explores dynamics in the movie industry, focusing on gender representations. The projects invites users to step into the shoes of different movie-industry perspectives such as a movie director, an actor or a spectator to uncover how gender equity influences cinematic outcomes. Through an interactive user interface, our project provides insights regarding the evolution of gender representation regarding specific features such as the repartition of movie-female director and actresses, as well as the roles impersonated by female actors over time and accross the world. By focusing how gender representation in movies has evolved over time, particularly after specific female empowering events such as obtaining the right to vote or the #MeToo movement.

Mov'She aims to raise awareness, promote the female impact over the movie industry and contribute to a more informed conversation on gender equality in cinema.

More specifically, Mov'She will address the following questions :
* How are women kicksided in movies ?
* Does the gender of the movie director influences the gender equity within actors ?
* Does gender parity among actors influence a movie’s economic performance, ratings, and global reach ?
* How does the gender of a movie director correlates with the role repartition between male and female actors ?

The methods used will combine :
1. data wrangling : epuration of the database by extracting and standardizing initial data files (detecting any missing, inconsistent or atypical data and applying accordingly resampling, deletion or transformation of data)
2. visual interactive representation of the analysis results
* qualitative and quantitative univariable analysis (histograms, box plot, scatter plot, ...)
* qualitative and quantitative multi-variable analysis (scatter plot, line plot, heatmap, ...)
* applying transformation on the axes if necessary
* displaying only essential data and expliciting the result for the audience
3. statistical analysis using robust statistics, tests
4. perform linear regression to build models and predictors
5. ML techniques including decision trees
6. sentiment analysis (?)

The tools used would be the following :
* wikipedia-api python library, to access data regarding the budget of the movie and the awards the movie or its actors received thanks to it
* interactive tools : (choose some amongst vega, vincent, bokeh, find other ?)

Timeline :
* until milestone 2 : clear definition of the objectives, analysis steps of the database and individual exploration
* week 10 : invidivual / pair work
* week 11 : sharing progress, redifining objectives / work distribution
* week 12 : individual / pair work
* week 13 : individual / pair work, pooling
* week 14 : finishing touches

Organization within the team (internal milestones up until Milestone P3) :
* week 9 - clear objectives, roles and tasks
* week 11 - first draft of the Jupyter Notebook (story telling included)
* week 13 - 90% of the Jupyter Notebook finished
* week 14 - finishing touches, UX & Artistic Direction (design, colors etc)

Questions for the TAs :
* we noticed that our dataset registers is a drastic drop of movies released after 2010, we think that might be because of lack of such recent data. Would it be possible to leave these data out of our analysis ?

you have to show -
That you can handle the data in its size.
That you understand what’s in the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).
That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.
That you have a reasonable plan and ideas for methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.
That your plan for analysis and communication is reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.
We will evaluate this milestone according to how well these steps have been done and documented, the quality of the code and its documentation, the feasibility and critical awareness of the project. We will also evaluate this milestone according to how clear, reasonable, and well thought-through the project idea is. Please use the second milestone to really check with us that everything is in order with your project (idea, feasibility, etc.) before you advance too much with the final Milestone P3! There will be project office hours dedicated to helping you.
