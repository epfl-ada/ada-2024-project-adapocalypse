# The Ultimate Super-Villain Guide

The ADAlien, a curious alien coming from a peaceful and harmonious planet, dreams of conquering a new planet and is determined to master the art of villainy to do so. During his journey in space, he discovers an old videotape guide untitled : "The Ultimate Super-Villain Guide.". The guide gathers and exploits data provided by thousands of human-made movies, a famous race in the villain community. It does not only provide insight regarding classic villain attributes, actions, and concrete movie portrayal but also analyses in depth character data and actor-character combinations amongst others. This guide will help the ADAlien to become the villain he is destined to be and prepare it for any planetary encounter.

The goal of this project is to understand what makes a good villain, in order for the ADAlien to adopt the most appropriate villain character for his space conquest.

More specifically, the guide will help the ADALien address the following questions :
· What are the main profiles of villain characters according to movie genres ?
· How do the different combinations of actor-character correlate with specific movie genres or roles ?
· Based on one’s individual information and movies preferences, which actor of the database could he/she impersonate ?

The methods used will combine :
· epuration of the database (detecting any missing or atypical data and treating it accordingly)
· qualitative and quantitative univariable analysis
· qualitative and quantitative multi-variable analysis
· statistical formulas
· sentiment analysis

Timeline :
· until milestone 2 : individual exploration of the database
· week 9 : sharing of findings and clear definition of roles & tasks (1 HMW 2 :) )
· week 10 : individual work (& HMW 2 :) )
· week 11 : sharing progress, redifining objectives / work distribution
· week 12 : individual work
· week 13 : individual work, pooling
· week 14 : finishing touches

Organization within the team (internal milestones up until Milestone P3) :
· attribution of roles
week 11 - first draft of the Jupyter Notebook (story telling included)
