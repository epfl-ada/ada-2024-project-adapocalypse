    "## \"MADAME\" - Studying women representation through Director’s Lens \n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The MADAME project explores the dynamics of female representation in cinema, focusing on how the gender of a movie director influences the portrayal of women. By examining character tropes, roles, and narrative functions, the project investigates how women are often sidelined, reduced to their appearance, or defined by their relationships with men. Through an in-depth analysis of plot summaries and character attributes, MADAME identifies trends in gender representation, tracing their evolution across genres and historical contexts. Readers will follow the story of Madame, who leads the analysis, uncovering insights and sparking discussions on gender equality in storytelling. The ultimate goal is to advocate for more inclusive and diverse narratives in film.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\"MADAME\" will explore the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the gender of a movie director influence the portrayal of women in cinema?\n",
    "What are the key female stereotypes in movies?\n",
    "How are women portrayed in films around the world?\n",
    "How has women’s representation in films evolved over time?\n",
