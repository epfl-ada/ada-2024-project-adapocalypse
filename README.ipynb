    "## \"MADAME\" - Studying Women representation through Movie Director’s lens \n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What do we do now?\" : this famous movie quote embodies how much women are discredited and set aside in cinema, often reduced to their appearance, or defined by their relationships with men. \n",
    "The MADAME project explores the dynamics of female representation in cinema, focusing on how the gender of a movie director influences the portrayal of women. By examining movie genres, character tropes, plot emotions and success, the project investigates how different male and female movie directors depict women. Through an in-depth analysis of plot summaries and character attributes, MADAME project identifies trends in gender representation, for both male and female directed movies. Readers will follow the story of Madame, who leads the analysis, uncovering insights and sparking discussions on the way male and female directors actually represent women in movies. The ultimate goal of our work is to question the rooted stereotypes in film industry to advocate for more inclusive and diverse narratives in film.\n",

    "First, to seek through the data, we decided to split the work according to the different datasets. While Coralie, Pernelle and Mahlia were assigned to the \"movie_metadata\" and \"character_metadata\" datasets, Maximilien was in charge of \"tv_tropes\" and \"plot_summaries\", Juliette worked on the \"IMDb\" ans \"TMDB\" datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, Juliette and Mahlia carried the data preprocessing, repository organisation and result analysis within it. Maximilien worked on methods functions and results analysis, and Coralie and Pernelle focused on developping and designing the webiste, as well as storytelling. \n",
    "To follow, Mahlia and Maximilien created a Machine Learning Model to predict the output of the Bechdel Test, given several movie features. \n",
